124319427612935_925734112888961,"I have always loved music. In my studio, Miles Davis or John Coltrane are often playing in the background. The element of jazz that delights me most is the spontaneity, the way the musicians communicate with each other through their instruments, making space for one another, building an invisible and intricate web of connection.

I believe that when we choose a piece of artwork, it is because something beacons our eyes and hearts and, without thinking too much about it, we fall in love.

The beauty of improvisation, to me, is perfectly embodied by a street musician playing the music that comes to him and the passerby who is moved to spontaneous dance. This interaction captures the magic of responding to the present moment and the opportunities it offers with our hearts.

When my children were small and visiting my studio, we would sometimes crank up the volume, clear the tables to the side of the room, and dance. I continue this tradition with my grandchildren and it never fails to delight us all. My hope is that this painting brings that fun free energy into your home, and invites you to dance 🙂

Our studio originally was founded in 1992 when our father Jean-Pierre was looking for a way to both create art and support our growing family.  He discovered that he could create 3D paintings by arranging different parts of an image on multiple levels of glass. 🎨 

About 10 years ago, the studio moved to Israel, where us daughters, Davida and Safira, 🖐️ joined, bringing new ideas and helping with the day to day operations. 

As a family studio, our relationships with each other is key to the feeling and energy that go into our work. You are part of our extended studio family. Thank you for following along!

Rachel's Tomb 

Tradition says she was buried by the road so that she could comfort her children as they were sent into exile. 
She is the motherly voice that prays for a softening when life is harsh. In her softness is her power. 

Her tomb is a holy site of prayer for Jews, Christisns and Muslims.

You are now sixteen 
So you are a queen 
You can have it your way 
And  just for today 
It's all about you!!
Then too..

For when you grow old 
You will always be bold 
Loved by all, but not told 
You cannot accomplish 
You're greatest wish 
To be you!

In that vein, Davida has started a YouTube series about wellbeing, taking moments from her life to reflect on small ways to be more conscious. We'll be posting links to some of her videos. Stay tuned :)",2020-11-09T12:00:02+0000,2,3,0

124319427612935_3248339378544242,"Our Mini Collection is here: 3D paintings on glass in our smallest size yet. Super cute pieces which can stand on a dresser or hang on the wall alone or in a set. They are a great way to say ""Thank You"" or ""I love you"", and are sure to elicit a smile or a laugh. Ironically, this collection really got rolling when Safira, Jean-Pierre's daughter and our Art Director, was in self-imposed quarantine. She spent weeks creating a series of delightful 4""x4"" 3D paintings on glass. Since then, we've taken this new Collection and run with it. Tell us what you think!

In Brief: We are giving away 30 gifts to 30 medical professionals of YOUR choice! 
The gift: A superhero themed 3D painting on glass from our Mini Collection. 

***Honoring the Superheroes of Today***

They work long shifts
Faced with uncertainty, supply shortages and their own mortality
On the front lines of this war
They fight for us.

These are our medical professionals
And we wish to honor them. 

In the current crisis, we, like many other small businesses, have pretty much closed shop.  
In “normal” times, we run a family studio for art:
We create paintings on multiple layers of glass and work with galleries and gift shops around the world. 
We love art and tried to think of a way to use our art
to spread encouragement and hope in this time.
And to express gratitude to a few of the heroes
who are on the front lines in this war. 

So... we are going to send this piece as a gift to 30 medical professionals of your choice! Everything, including shipping to North America on us!
The painting is 3-dimensional (two levels of glass and background) and designed by Safira - one of our talented artists and Jean-Pierre Weill’s youngest daughter.

Express your appreciation for our medical professionals today!
Do you know someone in the medical field who deserves a special thank you? All you need to do is:
1. Tag someone you know who is working hard to keep others safe in a comment to this post.
2. Write a few words that explain why you think they deserve a Thank You.
3. Share this post.
The 30 comments that receive the most Likes will win a superhero painting gift for the person they tagged!

We are thrilled to celebrate the 25th anniversary of Jean-Pierre Weill Studios! And we need your help.

We, Davida and Safira, had the pleasure of joining our father's studio several years ago. 
Over the years, our dad sold tens of thousands of paintings and books, and we would love to meet all of you who have made his artwork part of your homes and workspaces! So we are using social media platforms to reach out to our art community around the globe :)

Kevin Spacey and Ringo Starr are among those who love and own his artwork, and we're excited to meet everyone else.

So, how can you help?
1. Tag friends who own a Jean-Pierre Weill work
2. Share this post so we can get in touch with all our fans!
3. If you own a Jean-Pierre Weill, please comment with a photo of your painting or book in your home setting, with your location.

Looking forward to hearing from you and thank you so much!
Davida, Safira, and Jean-Pierre
